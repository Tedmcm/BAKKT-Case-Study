**What is BAKKT?**


Bakkt’s mission is to bring trust and transparency to the world of virtual assets bringing it more into the mainstream for consumers, merchants and institutional investors. To do this they have combined their world class custody and warehouse solutions with a regulated bitcoin options and futures trading system that was rolled out over the last two years.  Sometime in 2020 they will introduce their Consumer app that will allow consumers to store, manage, spend, trade and exchange all their virtual assets (fiat and crypto currencies, loyalty rewards & miles, points, tokens, virtual gaming assets etc) in one easy to use app. The company is targeting the estimated 1.2 trillion dollar market that is all things Virtual. The company has put together a world class group of investors and partners that is sure to bring instant credibility. There is just one huge problem for Bakkt; the founding principle of this new digital world seems to go against everything Bakkt stands for.. What do i mean by that? 

To the crypto purists...Trying to centralize and regulate the market goes against the very founding principle of Bitcoin and the crypto universe. You can also say the same for a large part of the video gaming/virtual asset community. So a key question to ask is? Will Bakkt’s relationship with Intercontinental Exchange (owner of the NYSE) be a benefit or actually hurt the company? There is no doubt that what they are attempting to do with their consumer app will revolutionize the loyalty/reward world and could possible unlock billions in value and potential change the public's understanding of the blockchain. 


The company was formed in 2018 by the Intercontinental Exchange which owns and operates commodities, futures and cash exchanges, data businesses, warehouses & custody solutions and central clearing houses globally. It was the brainchild of the ICE CEO Jeff Sprecher and his wife Kelly Loeffer (IR). Mr Sprecher is a legendary executive in the exchange world after having reportedly purchasing an electricity exchange for $1 and building it into a global power house worth over $50b. It is reported they have been planning and working in secret on this project for the last several years and are rolling it out in several phases. It has also been rumored they are also secretly working on another connected project that is going to go after the 25t global payments markets.

**Market Opportunity**

By Bakkt’s own estimation the addressable global market in virtual assets is valued in the neighborhood of 1.2 trillion dollars. Practically every adult in the world has at least one Loyalty or Reward program. According to Forbes “the average american has at least 12 programs.” The current BAKKT client list comprises 7 of the top 10 financial institutions, 500 of the leading gift card programs and at last count over 4500 merchants. When you combine BAKKT’s consumer app with the ability to pay anywhere that accepts Apple Pay or Google Pay, they basically have a current relationship with or touch in one way or another almost every adult in the country. Combining this with the fact that according to a 2017 study by Colloquy (the go to source for Global Loyalty insights), “48 trillion Rewards points worth $360b sleep in the customer accounts across the globe.” This is basically unspent cash sitting on the balance sheets of consumers that can be potentially unlocked with this solution. For businesses the benefits are enormous, it takes liabilities off their balance sheets and increases usage and loyalty. A win win for everyone.

**Competitors**

At the current time the company does not have any direct competitors that offer an equal set of products.The following would compete in a particular business line but at this point it would take a roll up or serious partnership program of multiple of the following companies to be able to offer Bakkt's announced product suite.

**Business lines**

**Crypto & Derivatives Trading**

The first phase was to roll out Bitcoin Futures and Options trading combined with an enterprise-grade Custody and Warehouse offering to service the institutional space. Starting in September of 2019 Bakkt launched daily and monthly futures contracts followed by the options on futures contracts in December 2019. The unique thing that sets them apart from their biggest competitors is the ability to take physical delivery vs CME’s and Kraken’s cash only settlement contracts (in Singapore Bakkt has cash settled contracts). Kraken, a UK based Crypto Exchange also offers futures trading on multiple Alt Coins as well (Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin). Of note, the CBOE entered the space in 2017 with a cash settle option but exited the market altogether in 2019. 

Why or how do Futures, Options on Futures and enterprise-grade warehouse capabilities help change the game for Bitcoin other Alt Coins? The finance industry has historically been slow to adopt new technologies. I think most people would be surprised at how antiquated some large financial institutions IT systems are. For Crypto Currencies or any new asset class for that matter to evolve into an institutional asset class the objections or hurdles for the institutional community have to be overcome. What issues kept institutional investors from more broadly trading and investing in the space? The list is long but includes: 

1. Reliability/durability/security of trading platforms
2. Liquidity
3. Transparency
4. Uniform and reliable pricing data
5. General volatility
6. Legal/regulatory uncertainty
7. Enterprise grade Custody/Warehouse platforms and the ability to hedge portfolios. 

With a recent partnership with GDT that I will discuss in the next section BAKKT has now done enough in my opinion to alleviate all of these concerns and paves the way for further adoption by the institutional community.

The second phase of their markets and trading strategy combines both the institutional, accredited investors and retail parts of the business. In June of 2020 it was announced they will be partnering with Galaxy Digital Trading (a division of Galaxy Digital) to provide trading capabilities including 24hr trading, sophisticated trading strategies, lending, structured products and derivatives. Galaxy’s trading volume was reported to be about 1 Billion in the first quarter of 2020 and with their ability to source volume from over 30 exchanges it should help alleviate any liquidity and pricing issues. When the consumer app ramps and gives people the ability to exchange and trade their loyalty points, tokens, miles and gift cards for crypto or fiat currencies, the Galaxy trading desk is going to be a big beneficiary of this partnership. Combining the two companies trading, custody and warehouses business with potentially 100s of billions of dollars per year in potential liquidity from previously unused loyalty rewards, this could be a power house in the virtual world. 

**Galaxy Digital**


Galaxy Digital’s current offering in the Crypto space includes Advisory services, Asset management, Research, Principle Investments and Trading. Their clients include: Bitcoin/Alt Coin Mining companies, Crypto Funds and VC companies, Family Offices and High Network Individuals, Businesses and Blockchain companies, Payment Custody and Financial Institutions, Hedge Funds, Asset Managers and Pension Funds.

**Why would Institutional Investors Trade with GDT/BAKKT?**

At this point I think it is important to explore how trading works in the real world with a simple explanation of Agency vs Principle Trading. Basically agency trading is when your trade goes directly into the market/exchange and connects with a buyer on other side of the market, this is how almost all traditional crypto trading is done. Simply matching buy and sell orders. Principle trading is how a lot of the trading on wall street is done between the buy side and sell side. For example, If Mutual fund company AMutual would like purchase ACME  company’s stock, the trader at AMutual calls the trader at Investment bank CTRADE. Depending on the wether or not CTRADE holds inventory in ACME will determines how that trade is executed. If CTRADE does not hold any inventory in ACME and just goes out into the open market to execute that trade, it is an agency trade. On the flip side, if CTRADE holds for example a 100,000 Shares of ACME, they can sell its own position/inventory to AMutual. This would be called a principle trade. Both are extremely common in the equity space and involve different risks for CTRADE as they are effectively buying for their own account and hoping to make a spread/profit when they complete the sale of that inventory. 

In the Crypto space there are only a couple of US based principle trading firms in the market currently. The two main competitors would be Anchorage Trading (2017-Provides Custody Service through Anchorage Trust) and Cumberland DRW (2014). As the space matures, volume and institutional acceptance increase I anticipate this space to get considerably more crowded. The reason this matters is that large institutional accounts need liquidity to buy or sell large amounts of any asset without moving the market and these firms allow them to do that. 

With the completion of the trading partnership with GDT,  Bakkt now has all the pieces in place to be the go to firm for institutional investors.

**Consumer App**






**The second phase...The Consumer APP**


Through their soon to be launched (2020) revolutionary consumer app they will offer a wallet that works just like a typical warm crypto wallet combined with a cold wallet for added security, but with several new and innovative products and features. Through the wallet they will offer consumers the ability to store, manage, trade/exchange, pay/transfer with and for fiat and crypto currencies, rewards/points/miles and virtual assets. By combining the warm/cold wallet system with enterprise grade storage systems/facilities and insurance policies of 500,000,000 million dollars it gives them a significant competitive advantage. For all customer data that is stored offline in cold facilities there is extensive physical security including bank grade vaults, not to mention serious name recognition all segments of the market will respect and trust. By using a Duel Wallet system of both Warm and Cold systems the company is attempting to overcome one of the biggest objections of a centralized system/exchange; ie..the concerns regarding funerablity of customer assets. 

**APP/WALLET Security Specifics**

1. The app has mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA).
2. IP Address and withdraw address whitelisting
3. Regular operational and security audits
4. Secure Wallet Architecture + Storage
5. Multi-signature transaction signing
6. Shamir’s Secret Sharing for key sharding. 
7. Hardware security modules (HSMs) to secure and authenticate keys.

What are security protocols for the wallet? Warehouse? Cards? 
Bakkt stores client private keys on hardened systems in cold storage and on FIPS 140-2 level 3 HSMs. All cryptographic material is stored on ICE owned and operated infrastructure and does not utilize co-locations or shared facilities. ICE owned facilities Include multi-zone physical security, biometrics, proximity badges, pin codes and 24x7 armed security (Source:Bakkt website). 

**AUDITS**
 								
Bakkt leverages industry best practices and rigorously audited cyber and physical security policies and procedures. This includes SOC 2 Type II audits of networks, systems, and facilities. Additionally, Bakkt is finalizing a SOC 1 Type I audit of its internal custody operations and procedures.

2. Private keys are created and stored on FIPS 140-2 level 3 hardware security modules (HSM’s) and no individual has access to private key material
3. Network connected, but all withdrawal requests are received, verified, and processed by dedicate staff located in multiple geographies; requests are validated, both manually and systematically, against a policy rule set that controls for parameters such as amount, destination, velocity of transactions
4. 24x7 on site, armed security
5. Advanced insider threat and anti-collusion controls

**Cold Wallet**

1. The majority of bitcoin stored in the Bakkt Warehouse is offline

***Retail/Consumer related trading on the APP***

Galaxy GDT  
As I touched on early in the study Bakkt has partnered with GDT, the trading division of Galaxy Digital. In the Crypto universe as I stated before most trading is done by retail investors by signing up to and trading directly with a crypto exchange. While Bakkt relationship with GDT is more focused on the institutinal side of the business and they havent specifically talked about retail trading volume, ie how these orders will be executed, I would suspect this volume will also run through GDT's desks.

**VIRTUAL ASSET EXCHANGE**

The virtual asset exchange business in my opinion will be the hardest to build and gain traction with due to a number of issues including:

1. Technical challenges/issues/standards 
2. Community trust
3.  Centralized vs decentralized exchange vs P2P
4. Buy-in from the game makers/publishers
5. A lack of industry standards

At this point the details surrounding this business have been slim and the only thing we can speculate on with any level of confidence is that it will most likely be some kind of centralized exchange. The current market for virtual assets is estimated to be over 50b a year. There are some very large players in the market like WAX, OpenSea, Hoard and of course the P2P segment. The number of subsegments is growing dramatically every year and with an estimated 1.2b gamers globally and only 400m of those online gamers, its a market that is sure to experience explosive growth in the years to come. 
 
 Wether your buying, selling or trading virtual art, trading cards, collectables, skins, or Crypto Kitties, the type of exchange you chose to to businss with is a big decision. 

Lets explore some of the pro's and con's of each type:

**Centralized Exchange**

**Pro's**
1. The exchange takes on financial, regulatory, legal and compliance risk 
2. The exchange takes custody risk
3. Better customer support 
4. Better pricing, liquidty, reliability

**Con's**

1. A large part of your potential customer base is against the very idea of a centralized exchange 
2. In the past wallet/funds/asset storage has been a common complaint about centralized exchanges( With Bakkt's hybrid system of both a warm/cold wallet combined with world class custody and warehouse systems this should alliviate any concerns in this area)


**Decentralized Exchange**

**Pro's**
1. No exchange-based centralized wallet, In the crypto/virtual asset/gaming world a large part of the community still believes their funds/asset are better off stored with them vs a centralized system. 
2. Reduced dependance on the exchange itself, ie big brother, goverments controll.
3. Deal-Matching and asset sales are realized through smart contracts, and user funds are in their control. 
4. The very real view/belief that by supporting the decentralized world is thereby, Progress. 

**Con's**

1. Expensive 
2. Slower Speeds 
3. User accountability may not be suitable for all participants 
4. Will Regulators/Governments act to bring this activity onto a centralized exchange or potentially shut down the exchange all together 
5. System vulnerability
6. Competiting against highly capitalized global players in the long run could put these exchanges at a disadvantage or out of business

**Rewards and Loyalty**

**Loyalty & Rewards Programs...Miles, Points, Gift Cards...Going after a Global Whale**

From the beginning of time businesses have thought of new and creative ways to keep customers coming back with all kinds of incentives like buy one get one free programs. In the early days you would be given a paper, stamp books, or a card that would show your credit that would apply to future purchases. Remember the old punch tickets each time you bought that sandwich/meal from your local restaurant? But it was not until American Airlines created the first frequent flyer program in 1981 that the modern era of loyalty programs was born on a large scale. It was a simple yet effective structure, each time you flew with the airline you would receive credit, called miles, that you could apply to future flights. With the advent of computers and more advanced payment systems the ability of businesses to offer more sophisticated structures for tracking, analysing and using these miles, discounts or rewards became a reality. Around this time we also saw the emergence of outsourced specialty loyalty companies that enabled any company to use turn key solutions to roll out and manage a more sophisticated program than they could build or manage internally. But, even as the industry evolved over the years and plans got more and more innovative there has always been the same pluses and minuses. 
By some estimates there are literally hundreds of stand alone outsourcing loyalty companies that offer a full suite of programs you can implement in a quick, cost effective and efficient manner. Bakkt and most of these companies offer some kind of SAS platform that lets companies do the following:

1. Ready made suite of programs to offer
2. Card Issuance
3. Advertising, promotion management, and social media programs
4. Data Management and Analytics 
5. AI
6. Currency, credit management systems
7. Depending on size, potential partnerships/syndicates to collaborate with 
8. Travel agencies or VIP services 
9. Fraud protection

But the real breakthrough came with the introduction of an industry changing payment solution that enabled the use of rewards currencies in retail stores at the POS and in app through a digit wallet. This solution was called Loyalty Pay and was created by Bridge2 Solutions, the company that was acquired by Bakkt in February of 2020.  What Bridge2 brought to Bakkt is the key relationships with 7 of the top 10 financial institutions in the US, two premier airlines, 500 gift card merchant relationships and 4500 merchants and the ability to use Loyalty Pay (with Apple Pay and Google Pay).

**Is there anything left to do? Thoughts and my suggestions..**

1. The first thing I would have pushed for is to make all their clients programs be based on the blockchain. Convert all the programs miles/points/gift cards etc.. and make them blockchain based coins or tokens and try and standardize the industry. 
2. Partner with EBAY to build out the virtual asset exchange business. It was rumored they had discussed a deal to buy EBAY and planned to use the tech backbone of the auction site for their virtual asset exchange. Another option would be to buy a smaller aution site with best in class tech.  


2. Buy Twitch, buying this trusted gaming platform and using this as a beachhead into the gaming world I think makes alot of sense and brings you closer to the next generation of consumers globally. If you could find a way to integrate/link the exchange with the twitch platform it could be extremely powerful given Bakkt's product suite.   

3. Buy one of the largest Crypto exchanges.

4. Buy Galaxy Digital, Bringing this platform under the BAKKT umbrella could provide a ton of synergies. Build Galaxy out to be the number one investment bank type company in the virtual world. Expand on the research capabilities and offer all clients of the plafrom those research capabilities just like JPM or GS do. Also, by making the deal it would increase the size of the GDT balance sheet thereby increasing the trading capabilities. 

5. Location based offers, use geo-location-based technology combined with machine learning and AI on the data from the inhouse loyalty reward business combined with the data coming in from the app could prove to be a huge driver of revenue.  

6. In App advertising.

7. Build a system/feature into the App that would do sales and promotions combining benefits from across the app, create the ability to cross sell and do package deals. For example, last minute flash sales, sell points, miles, gift cards today only and our inhouse travel agent will book you this dream vacation.   

8. Offer stock, options and futures trading to customers. They are in a unique position to offer a global suite of products unrivaled in the investment world. 

9. Set up a division of the company that would sell all the data from Bakkt to the buy side. Integrate AI and Machine into the platform, visualisize and link to tickers with Tableau.

**Summary and Conclusion:**

When Jeff and Kelly set out on this journey to create Bakkt and bring the virtual asset world into the main stream it was a monumental task. The components it would take span numerous different domains and industries with divergent technologies/structure/expertise, consumer traits and behaviours, and different regulatory regimes. 
Lets review what they have done:

1. Set up the first and only end to end solution for institutional investors, ie, principle trading, futures, options on futures, the ability to settle in physical and cash, and enterprise grade custody and warehouse services. This set of capibiities is the only one on the market and will be very hard to replicate. 
2. Set up a one of a kind consumer wallet with the ability to store, buy/sell/trade/pay and exchange both Fiat and Crypto Currencies, buy/sell/trade/pay with all kinds of loyal/rewards points/miles and gift cards and do this in probably the most secure enviroment possible with the backing of the most recoginzed exchanges in the world. 

3. Combined one of the leading Loyal/Rewards/Payment programs with capabilites never before seen in the industry. Finally being able to monetize those assets in a way consumers have only dreamed of. I think when this app hits we could see a flood of business come into the Bakkt system as merchants see the uptake explode and as consumer demand companies join the network. 

4. Virtual Asset Exchange..While we dont currently know exactly what they product is or what the capabilities are, judging by other components im expecting they swing for the fences (going for the home run). If they can find a way of easing the concerns of the players, game developers and publishers it would be a huge accomplishement. 

So to sum up, Bakkt in my opinion is going to revolutionize the Crypto space by helping to bring in more institutional capital, the Loyalty and Rewards industry by allowing consumers to more freely monitize 100's billions in unused assets, and hopefully finally cracking the virtual/gaming asset's world most complicated issues (ie, ownership rights, being able to easily trade/exchange assets in a secure/legal/transparent way, and by giving game developers and publishers a trusted base to build on to futher develope capabilites to monetize the gaming world).
