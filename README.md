** What is BAKKT?**


   Bakkt’s mission is to bring trust and transparency to the world of virtual assets bringing it more into the mainstream for consumers, merchants and institutional investors. To do this they have combined their world class custody and warehouse solutions with a regulated bitcoin options and futures trading system that was rolled out over the last two years.  Sometime in 2020 they will introduce their Consumer app that will allow consumers to store, manage, spend, trade and exchange all their virtual assets (loyalty rewards, miles, points, tokens, virtual gaming assets etc) in one easy to use app. The company is targeting the estimated 1.2 trillion dollar market that is all things Virtual. The company has put together a world class group of investors and partners that is sure to bring instant credibility. There is just one huge problem for Bakkt; the founding principle of this new digital world seems to go against everything Bakkt stands for.. What do i mean by that? 

To the crypto purists...Trying to centralize and regulate the market goes against the very founding principle of Bitcoin and the crypto universe. Can these two things co-exist? Will Bakkt’s relationship with Intercontinental Exchange (owner of the NYSE) be a benefit or actually hurt the company? There is no doubt that what they are attempting to do with their consumer app will revolutionize the loyalty/reward world and could possible unlock billions in value and potential change the public's understanding of the blockchain. 

	The company was formed in 2018 by the Intercontinental Exchange which owns and operates commodities exchanges, futures exchanges, cash exchanges, data businesses, warehouses & custody businesses and central clearing houses globally. It was the brainchild of the CEO Jeff Sprecher and his wife Kelly Loeffer (IR). Mr Sprecher is a legendary executive in the exchange world after having reportedly purchasing an electricity exchange for $1 and building it into a global power house worth over $50b. It is reported they have been planning and working in secret on this project for the last several years and are rolling it out in several phases. It has also been rumored they are also secretly working on another connected project that is going to go after the 25t global payments markets.
